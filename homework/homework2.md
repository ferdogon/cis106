# Homework 2 | PART 1
**What are the advantages of open source?**
There are plenty of advantages that open-source offers to the users and developers.
Some of them are having no cost at all instead of worrying about licensing every once in a while.
Most of open source software are high-quality software.
Also, transparency is very good because when used, users can figure out how the software works.
**What are the basic freedoms that make a software open source?**
Freedoms that open-sources have compared to closed-source software are being able to run , copy, distribute, change or even improve the software that fits your needs.
**Do you agree with Richard Stallman? Do you disagree? Explain your answer.**
I agree with the fact that open-sourced software should be freely given to the users and even if the user does not know how to program he/she can pay others to alter the software to help and work for the users and being distributable helps as well which works in a way that the developer can share the altered software with others.
