## Scenario 3 
For Johanna steamos will help her a lot because in the first place games run much smoother on STEAMOS.Valve posted a performance test of Left 4 Dead 2 running on Windows 7 and on Ubuntu, and the Linux build came out ahead. I believe STEAMOS will help her a lot and will not regret switching from windows.

## Scenario 4
Lubuntu is a fast and lightweight operating system with a clean and easy-to-use user interface. It is a Linux system, that uses the minimal desktop LXDE/LXQT, and a selection of light applications. Because of this, Lubuntu has very low hardware requirements. Because the specs of Georgina's hardware are too low, lubuntu will help her a lot because it is basically ubuntu that is designed for low-end computers.
