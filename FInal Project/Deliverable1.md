Me as a Minecraft player, want to know how are the servers hosted and want to have more knowledge about the relationship of games with networking. I would want to choose more challenging projects but unfortunately, I currently do not have the time.

I might come across a lot of networking terms and commands. The networking part might be difficult to configure as well.

Trying my best if not Using Google, contacting my professors, or asking for help from other IT people.

## How do you think completing this project will help you in your career?
Because my goal is to work at a gaming company as a network admin having the knowledge to build a server for one of the most played games should help me at least get the idea of future projects of the company.
